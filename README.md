## Simple Single Player Solar System Survival Game!

Move the planets across their orbits to avoid them being destroyed by the ASTEROIDS.
The Sun can EAT the asteroids and Materialise it for FUEL.
The Sun can spend the fuel to Spit FIREBALLS to destroy Asteroids. (Bonus Points)
Collect Power Ups to assist your Survival!
Every time the sun eats an asteroid you get 10 points.
The score increments each second multiplied by the current total of planets.
Every 500 points  you get a free planet!
If you have no remaining planets, the game will end.
Go for as long as you can!
